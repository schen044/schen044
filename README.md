Hello! I'm Serra!<br><br>
I'm a software engineer with experience building full stack apps using both the MERN stack as well as Django/Python.<br><br>
When I'm not üéÆgaming or working on my ‚å®Ô∏è‚Ääkeyboards, I'm trolling the internet for the next project to add to my every growing list of "Things To Try".
